Find out the highest possible countable time interval using TIMER0, normal mode, and a
suitable pre-scalar. Assume XTAL= 16MHz.

What is the selected prescaler?
1:1024
(To get the maximum delay we use maximum prescalar)

What is the highest countable time interval?

XTAL = 16MHz → T = 1 / 16 μs
prescaler = 1:1024 → T(counter_clock) = 1024 × 1/16 μs = 64 μs

Highest countable time interval = 256 x 64 μs = 16.384 ms
