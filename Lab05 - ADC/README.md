## Introduction of ADC devices
Analog-to-digital converters are among the most widely used devices for data acquisition.
Digital computers use binary (discrete) values, but in the physical world, everything is
analog (continuous). Temperature, pressure (wind or liquid), humidity, and velocity are a
few examples of physical quantities that we deal with every day. A physical quantity is
converted to electrical (voltage, current) signals using a device called as a transducer.
Transducers are also referred to as sensors. Sensors for temperature, velocity, pressure,
light and many other natural quantities produce an output that is an analog voltage (or
current). Therefore, we need an analog-to-digital converter to translate the analog signals to
digital numbers, so that the microcontroller can read and process them.
